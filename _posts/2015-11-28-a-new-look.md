I realize that I have not posted to this blog for over a year. After looking
over it again, I felt that the current design looked a bit dated and decided to
give it a bit of a facelift. I wanted a look that is cleaner, better focused
on the content, and more flexible for different types of media, whether it be
text, code, images, or embedded content.

I began by reducing the size of the ridiculously large heading, making it look
like a more conventional navbar, and giving it a dark background. Then, I shrunk
the sidebar and expanded the main content, added a subtle blue background color
to the sidebar modules for contrast, and changed the link color from red to
blue. To match the header, I applied dark backgrounds to the page footer and
pager buttons and changed the color scheme of the code blocks from
base16-ocean-light to its [dark variant][base16-ocean-dark].

In addition, I restored the font sizes of `h1`-`h6` heading tags to Bootstrap's
defaults and using the normal font weight in order to better bring out the
beauty of Kunth's [Computer Modern][computer-modern] typefaces. Finally, I
converted the style sheets from [Less][less] to [Sass][sass] in order to take
advantage of [Jekyll's built-in Sass support][jekyll-sass]. After all, Bootstrap
is also [moving from Less to Sass][bootstrap-sass] starting with
[Bootstrap 4][bootstrap-4].

As for content, there are many topics that I am either itching to write about or
have started writing. I have also slightly reorganized my blog categories since
I am planning to expand the scope of this blog to also include some of my
non-software hobbies and interests. In any event, I am expecting to update this
blog a lot more frequently, so stay tuned.
